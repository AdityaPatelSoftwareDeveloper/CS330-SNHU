# 3D Replication Project for Triangle and Cube Studios

## Project Overview

This repository contains the deliverables for a 3D replication project assigned by Triangle and Cube Studios. The objective was to create a 3D model based on a 2D image provided by the client, intended for 3D printing as a preliminary concept for their business.

### Contents

- **3DModel.zip**
  - This ZIP file includes all the files required to set up and view the 3D model created for this project. It contains the 3D objects, texture files, and a brief guide on how to interact with the model in a virtual environment.

### Software Design

- **OpenGL Utilization:** The project involved writing code in OpenGL to create geometric shapes, apply textures, implement lighting, and manage rendering processes. This setup was crucial in simulating a realistic approximation of the provided 2D image.

- **Virtual Camera Control:** Careful manipulation of the virtual camera was necessary to provide the correct perspectives and depth, ensuring the 3D model accurately represented the 2D original.

### Development Process

- **Modeling:** Started with basic geometric shapes to form the rough structure of the 3D model. Used cubes and other primitives as the primary building blocks.

- **Texturing and Lighting:** Applied simple textures to enhance the visual quality of the model. Basic lighting techniques were used to highlight features of the model effectively.

- **Iteration:** The model underwent several iterations based on feedback from the client to refine shapes and textures, ensuring the final product met their requirements.


## Reflection

This project helped deepen my understanding of graphical programming and 3D model creation. It also highlighted the importance of client feedback in the iterative design process, ensuring the final product not only meets but exceeds client expectations.
